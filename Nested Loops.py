# In Python programming language there are two types of
# loops which are for loop and while loop. Using these loops
# we can create nested loops in Python. Nested loops mean
# loops inside a loop. For example, while loop inside the
# for loop, for loop inside the for loop, etc
#
# row = int(input("enter the number of row:"))
#
# for i in range(1, row+1):
#     for j in range(0, i):
#         print("*", end=" ")
#     print("")


# Printing multiplication table using Python nested for loops:
# for i in range(2, 4):
#     for j in range(1, 11):
#         print(i, "*", j, "=", i*j)
#     print()
