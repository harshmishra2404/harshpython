# Break Statement:
# The break statement in Python is used to terminate the
# loop or statement in which it is present.

# for i in range(11):
#
#     if i == 5:  # now here "i" is equal to 5 that's why no other number will print
#         break
#     print(i)


# for num in range(10):
#     num += 1
#     if num == 8:
#         break
#     print("The num has value:", num)
# print("Out of loop")

# for i in range(1, 5):
#     for j in range(2, 6):
#         if j%i == 0:
#             break
#         print(i, j)

# Continue Statement:Python Continue Statement skips the execution of the program block after the
# continue statement and forces the control to start
# the next iteration

# for i in range(1, 11):
#     if i == 7:
#         print(" ")
#         continue
#     else:
#         print(i)


# Pass Statement:When the user does not know what code to write,
# So user simply places a pass at that line.

# n = 10
# for i in range(n):
#     pass


# a = 10
# b = 20
# if(a<b):
#     pass
# else:
#     print("b<a")
